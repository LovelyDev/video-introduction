Dear everyone.
This is Koni Sam from Canada.
I'm a fullstack & blockchain developer with 8+ years experience
 in dynamic and deadline-driven work environments.
Self-motivated and self-taught professional who always trends to
challenge difficult problems no one dares to try.

I went to Hong Kong Polytechnic University from 2011 majoring at Computer Engineering and graduated at 2015 with Degrees of Bachelor and Master both.
I gained a lot of experience in web development and 
various kinds of blockchain techniques through the developer life in several companies.
I steped into my developer career on Toptal which is one of the most popular remote job sites
 and I got a chance to be hired as a fullstack engineer in a FOLIO3, 
which is a kind of big company located in Toronto and I worked there for about 2 years.
After that, I looked for another chance to build my own team and my own ideas 
and fortunately I could enjoy the life of Project Manager and Team Leader at Angry Nerds.

I started my developer career not only for filling my pockets but also my heart because web development is my passion
and hobby itself. Not boasting of me, I always trends to challenge difficult problems which no one dares to 
try and when I overcome it, I feel closer to my goal.
Actually I wrote my first program on a Commodore64 at age 6. I built my first website at age 13 at the dawn of
the home internet connection.
I always wanted to be a software engineer.

Okay. That is so much for talking about my experience and you can check my skills
 and past companies and everything in my CV uploaded on this site and you can also check my full development history from 2013

Okay. Thanks for visiting my profile and hope to see you in the interview for your project.
